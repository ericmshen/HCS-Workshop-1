## Eric Shen

Here's my rendition of HCS's first assignment, a charming React Portfolio. This being my first time using React, I've made some pretty basic changes, but everything works, and that's the important part.

### Details on About Page

A simple button provides some more information on the About page, and also counts the number of times the button has been clicked (just as a demonstration of state/prop variables).

### Education

An Education section provides a list of attended schools, and upon selecting a specific school, more information is displayed at left. The design of this is very similar to the Experiences section, but with a few more props and the layout of the page slightly changed.

### Other notes
A simple footer is appended to the bottom of every page, and the top navbar has been somewhat expanded. There are also small styling changes.
