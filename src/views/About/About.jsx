          <p>I'm a Harvard '24 student currently interested in studying Applied Mathematics, although everything is still 
            up for grabs. As is shown by this project, I'm also currently exploring computer science, which is a rather
            new field for me. When I'm less busy, you can find me biking around (since I'm still stuck in the neighborhood),
            anticipating hitting the slopes, or making fried rice.
